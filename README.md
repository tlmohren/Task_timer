# Work timer
A GUI experiment using PyQt5.

## Goals:
- have a timer in lower right corner that logs tasks
- have it be a stable executable file
- use non-intrusive graphics (e.g. transparency? )

## Ideas to look at:

## issues:
- when time runs out, button is still named pause, switching function not accessible from that branch
- graphics still too intrusive, not simple enough
- setting taskbar icon doesn't seem to work, somehow uses blank icon, related to spyder somehow?
